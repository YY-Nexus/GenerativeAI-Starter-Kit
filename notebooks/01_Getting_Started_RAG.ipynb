    "- **Retrieval**: Finding relevant information from a knowledge base\n",
    "- **Generation**: Using an LLM to generate responses based on retrieved context\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach allows AI systems to access up-to-date information and provide more accurate, source-backed responses.\n",
    "\n",
    "## What You'll Learn\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Set up a vector database for document storage\n",
    "2. Add documents to your knowledge base\n",
    "3. Perform semantic search and retrieval\n",
