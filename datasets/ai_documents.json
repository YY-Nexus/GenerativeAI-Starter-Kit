Unlike traditional programming where explicit \n            instructions are provided, ML systems learn patterns from data to make predictions \n            or decisions. The three main types of machine learning are supervised learning, \n            unsupervised learning, and reinforcement learning. Supervised learning uses labeled \n            data to train models, unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data, and \n            reinforcement learning learns through interaction with an environment.\n            ",
